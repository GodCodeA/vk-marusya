## Project structure
- `src/` — React + TypeScript source files
- `src/pages` — pages (Home, Genres, Movie, Profile, etc.)
- `src/components` — reusable components (modals, search, trailer)
- `src/api` — backend API methods
- `src/styles` — global styles

## Live demo
- https://vk-marusya.pages.dev

## API
The project uses `https://cinemaguide.skillbox.cc` as the `baseURL` (see `src/api/http.ts`). If you need to change the API address, update `src/api/http.ts`.

## Deployment
Cloudflare is recommended — connect the repository, set the build command to `npm run build`, and publish the `dist` folder.

## Add an About page (optional)
You can render `README.md` inside the app using `react-markdown` and create a `/about` route.
